title: Why I'm Learning to Develop Software
author: Lucas Moore
---

As I'm in the home stretch of coding school, I've started to reflect on what motivates me to learn this stuff.

## The power of being highly skilled at something

I've always been a tinkerer. I taught myself HTML and CSS in high school. I was that kid that installed games on my TI-83 calculator. I used to make custom themes for iPods by modifying the firmware with software called *iPodWizard*. 

Tinkering with things provides an immense intellectual satisfaction for me. Take it apart. See how it works. Piece it back together.

Building projects that pull from public APIs, or allow a user to sign in with Facebook feels that much more satisfying to me. Programming is like a superpower, closer to the cusp of the radically innovative movements of the internet. 

## Program or Be Programmed

I recently read a great book by Douglas Rushkoff called [Program or Be Programmed](http://www.rushkoff.com/books/program-or-be-programmed/). In it, he talks of how technology is so swiftly modifying the world we live in. Our manner of interacting with people, with information and with each other is shaped by programs that someone wrote, whether on our phone or computer. He says: 

# "Technology is fast becoming the boundries of our perceptual and conceptual apparatus; the edge between our nervous systems and everyone else's, our understanding of the world and the world itself."

So by learning to program, I have more understanding of the ways software is shaping our perception. When I see a gap, I now know how to build something to fill it. He goes on to explain: 

# "Programming is the sweet spot, the high leverage point in a digital society. If we don't learn to program, we risk being programmed ourselves."

## The Open Source Web

My ultimate goal for learning how to program is to participate in the beautiful community of [Open Source Projects](https://opensource.org/faq). Philisophically, I love that so many projects are decidely open source. The code is out in the open, for anyone to read, tinker with and submit modifications to. This community is moving both the internet and humanity forward. Open Source projects are building things that work well and putting it out there to share, instead of keeping everything locked up and private.

Rushkoff sums this movement up quite well:

# "In the long term, if we take up this challenge, we are looking at nothing less than the conscious, collective intervention of human beings in their own evolution."
