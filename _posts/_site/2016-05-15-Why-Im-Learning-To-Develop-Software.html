<p>As I’m in the home stretch of coding school, I’ve started to reflect on what motivates me to learn this stuff. There’s a few reasons I’m learning software development.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a tinkerer. I learned HTML and CSS in high school. I was the kid that installed games on my TI-83. I used to make custom themes for iPods by modifying the firmware with iPodWizard. Tinkering with things provides me immense intellectual satisfaction, but I want to do more than just tinker.</p>

<p>I’m learning to code because this is a specialized set of skills, which holds more power (and therefore more fun!). It’s got all the same joy of tinkering with code, but I’ve got a more deep understanding of what is being built by those lines of code.</p>

<p>Technology has changed our world so vastly in the past decade. That rate is only increasing. To be as close to the forefront of technology is a skill and privledge.</p>
