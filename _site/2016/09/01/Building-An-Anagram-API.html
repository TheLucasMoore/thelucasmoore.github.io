    <h2 id="anagrammatist">Anagrammatist</h2>

<p>An anagrammatist is someone who create anagrams. This is the API for aspiring annagrammatists.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h2>

<p>The goal for this API is to return anagrams for any word as quickly as possible.
The data store of this API digests a text file of every word in the English language (or at least the 235,886 most frequently used words).
Then the results of anagrams for any word are instantly available.</p>

<p>This API is built in Ruby, utilizing Sinatra to render JSON data at each end point. <a href="https://anagrammatist.herokuapp.com/">The deployed app</a> has a front end built with Angular, for instant search of the whole database.</p>

<h2 id="design-overview-and-trade-offs-considered">Design overview and trade-offs considered</h2>

<p>I am always intentional with the things I design, sketching out the overarching structure on paper before digging into the build. Here’s a few things I considered and the final decisions I made.</p>

<h1 id="sinatra-vs-rails">Sinatra vs. Rails</h1>

<p>The decision to use Sinatra instead of Rails here was purposeful. Rails is a fully featured MVC framework. I do love to build things with Rails, but it seemed like overkill to simply run one model, one controller and one view. Additionally, while some of the magic of Rails can be nice, I wanted to build the environment, tests and database configuration entirely on my own. I’m hungry to learn and I seek out challenges.</p>

<p>One example of such a challenge came with an app crash at deployment. I learned that I needed to manually export the $RACK_ENV variable to Heroku in my Procfile for this web application to function. The Rails apps I’ve deployed in the past seemed to handle this easily, but I enjoy developing as deeply as possible. In this case, I got to build out the Rack Middleware environments for testing, development and deployment entirely by myself. (along with Stackoverflow, of course)</p>

<h1 id="activerecord-vs-redis">ActiveRecord vs. Redis</h1>

<p>My first instinct with the need for a fast API was to create a datastore in Redis. While this would be fast, having 200,000+ words loaded into memory and not persisted to a database had a bit of a funky code smell to it. I tried it and did not like it.</p>

<p>The one advantage of this decision remained however. The delete end point would simply be clearing the cache from memory (<code class="highlighter-rouge">redis.flushall</code>) instead of destroying the contents of the database. In production, with so many words in the database, re-seeding it will take quite a while.</p>

<p>When considering the end user’s story for interacting with this API, they simply want instant results. Using ActiveRecord to store the Anagram model, as well as the ability to seed the database with the contents of the entire dictionary, has meant that the queries to the API are essentially instant. <a href="https://anagrammatist.herokuapp.com/">You can see that here.</a></p>

<h1 id="data-structure">Data Structure</h1>

<p>Each anagram is found by it’s key, which is the word split into letters, sorted and joined back together. Words with the same key are stored in an array called ‘words’ in the Anagram class. This process of finding the key for a word is done in the controller with a helper:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">find_key</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">word</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">sort</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">find_key</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"read"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; "ader"</span>

<span class="n">anagram</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Anagram</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">key: </span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">anagram</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"ader"</span>
<span class="n">anagram</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">words</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"ared"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"read"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"dare"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"dear"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="creating-this-in-your-local-environment">Creating this in your local environment</h2>

<p>To begin to develop with this API in your local environment, first, email me so I can add you to the private github repo. Then fork/clone this repo. If you’re working out the zip file, well, perfect. We’re ready to get started.</p>

<h1 id="set-up-testing">Set Up, Testing</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> to install the dependencies</li>
  <li>Be sure the Postgres is running. Then run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake db:create</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake db:migrate</code> and (optionally) <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake db:seed</code>. Note that seeding 200,000+ words take a very long time. It’s intentionally designed to run in production, which took place in the background. The tests of the API functionality will work with or without the seeding the development environment.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">thin start</code> will serve up the API and front end at <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:3000</code>. The server must be running for the tests to pass.</li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby run_tests.rb</code> during development to ensure you haven’t broken the core functionality or model validations.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="interacting-with-the-local-api">Interacting with the Local API</h1>

<p>These commands will show you how the API works locally.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{bash}"># Adding words to the corpus
$ curl -i -X POST -d '{ "words": ["read", "dear", "dare"] }' http://localhost:3000/words.json

</code></pre>

<h2 id="interacting-with-the-live-api">Interacting with the Live API</h2>

<p>While the live API page currently has the anagram search function enabled, the entire API is actually live and working.</p>

<p>To see this API running, simply change <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:3000</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://anagrammatist.herokuapp.com</code> in the curl commands above. Note that it’s running on hobby-dev Heroku, so there’s going to be room for improvement in performance. Those dynamos get sleepy after a while.</p>

<p>For one example, to grab the anagrams for any word:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl -i https://anagrammatist.herokuapp.com//anagrams/read.json
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note, the DELETE ALL end point has been disabled in production. Sure, we could build out an authorization scheme with JWTs to ensure only admins can use it, or utilize the famously heavy Devise gem. Or perhaps CanCanCan for permissions. But let’s keep it simple, alright? Nobody can delete the data store if the end point doesn’t even exist.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-add-to-the-api">Features to add to the API</h2>

<p>One bonus feature I did add was an anagram checker. Any set of words posted will return <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>, depending on whether the words are anagrams of each other.</p>

<p>The other feature I added is to delete a word AND all of it’s anagrams.</p>

<p>Additional features that would be interesting to add are end points to return data, like maximum/minimum/average number of anagrams in the database. This can be done with custom Postgres queries or using ActiveRecord’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Anagram.find_by_sql("SELECT ... yadayadayada")</code> ability.</p>

<p>I’d love to implement anagrams with multiple words or entire sentences.
Things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">no more stars</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">astronomers</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">a perfectionist</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">I often practice</code> or, my favorite, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Election results</code> and	<code class="highlighter-rouge">Lies – let's recount</code>. This would require some fixes on spacing and a bigger source of data.</p>

<h2 id="uses-scrabble">Uses? Scrabble!</h2>

<p>The live search functionality here does not discriminate on whether the text entered is a word or not. It searches by the key, so this app is a perfectly useful scrabble word solver. Enter some (or all) of the letters on your board and you’re <s>cheating</s> winning in no time!</p>

<p><img src="http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/e1/Manage-a-Rack-in-Scrabble-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1916432-728px-Manage-a-Rack-in-Scrabble-Step-3-Version-2.jpg" alt="anagrams and scrabble" /></p>

<p>“What? Oh no, I’m just texting someone. I’m not cheating at family scrabble on my phone with a web application I built.” -me, probably soon.</p>
