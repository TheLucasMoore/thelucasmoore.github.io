Hey there. My name is Lucas. I'm a web developer and graduate of Learn.co. 
I currently work as a freelance web developer and help coach other students through the program. I debug all day long and write about what I learn.

Besides Ruby on Rails, I'm interested in spoken languages, meditation and accelerated learning. 

Simple is always best.
