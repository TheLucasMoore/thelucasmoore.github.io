Hey there. My name is Lucas. I'm a software engineer and graduate of [Learn.co](https://flatironschool.com/campuses/online/). I currently work as a Platform Engineer at [Ibotta](https://ibotta.com/register?friend=jlhfxqn). I debug all day long and write about what I learn.

Besides Ruby on Rails, I'm interested in spoken languages, meditation and accelerated learning.

Simple is always best.
